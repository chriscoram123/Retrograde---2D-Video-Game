// GML script / pseudocode for Retrogrde video game
// PAGE ONE:


// Player Movement...
// Left And Right
1)  if(keyboard_check(vk_right)) x = x + 4; // (Activate running animation)
2)  if(keyboard_check(vk_left)) x = x - 4; // (Activate running animation)

// Jumping and Crouching
1)  if(keyboard(vk_up)) y = y + 4; // Player will jump and stay airborn for x amount of seconds(Activate jumping animation);
2)  if(keyboard(vk_down)) y = y - 4; // Player will crouch(Activate crouching animation);


// Main Triggers...
// Objects instantiate when player moves from one room to the other
1)  if(Player moves from one room to the other) room_instance_add(ind, x, y, obj); 
     x = x - 7;
     // This function can add an instance into any room except for the current one.
        Then object moves negative x units relative to the position it originated from

// Fire bullet on key command
2)  direction = point_direction(x, y, mouse_x, mouse_y);
    image_angle = direction;
     Mouse Global Left Pressed event:
      with (instance_create(x, y, obj_bullet)) {
       direction = other.direction;
       image_angle = direction;
       speed = 5;
    }

// Enemy destroy when bullet makes contact
1)  if(bullet collides with object) instance_destroy(object);
     // once player fires bullet and it collides with object, the object will be
        destroyed from room unless the game reloads
